## User Story
AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project


## Prerequisites

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality. Revisit the Screencastify Tutorial in the prework as a refresher on how to record video from your computer. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.


## How to use
1-Run node index.js
2-Follow prompts to enter information
3-Run preview of ReadMe
